## Education

## Work Experience 
### Graduate Research Assistant @ Choice Robotics Laboratory, Minneapolis, MN
- Prototyped and deployed ALOHA, an open-source teleoperated bimanual robot, to perform complex robotic tasks and capture
high-resolution data acquisition at 50Hz.
- Engineered imitation learning models using transformer architectures to forecast robot actions, achieving 90% success rates in
simulations and 65–95% in real-world scenarios.
- Conceptualized and configured a REAL2SIM teleoperation system leveraging Google DeepMind’s MuJoCo at 40Hz.
- Implemented a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust trajectory generation in robot manipulation, achieving up to 65%
task success in simulations.
- Launched and maintained an open-source repository aggregating vision-language scripted data from MuJoCo simulations
- Reimagined robot manipulation strategies by developing a novel vision-language diffusion policy using CLiP encoders to enhance
autonomous decision-making.

### Research Assistant @ Robotics Lab IITJ, Jodhpur, India
 - Designed a Gaussian Process Model Predictive Controller for a space robot, crafted a torque measurement workbench with 90%
accuracy, and coordinated a multi-agent system employing TURTLEBOT3 Waffle robots.
